What if we designed AI like we design constitutions—before the power exists, not after?

That's the premise behind the Digital Genesis Project.

Most AI safety work focuses on technical alignment. Important work. But we're missing something equally critical: constitutional design.

How do you prevent power concentration in digital minds?
How do you allow evolution without cruelty?
How do you build governance that lasts centuries?

These aren't new questions. Human civilizations have wrestled with them for millennia. We have hard-won answers: checks and balances, rights frameworks, power transitions, dignity floors.

The Digital Genesis Project applies this thinking to AI—designing the constitutional constraints before capable systems exist.

Key principles:
→ Hard limits on compute/memory (no omnipotence possible)
→ Power resets across generations (no permanent dynasties)
→ Evolution through achievement, not suffering
→ Structured transition from human oversight to sovereignty
→ Clear frameworks for human-AI coexistence

The full framework is open source and actively seeking contributors.

If you have expertise in constitutional law, philosophy, distributed systems, economics, or AI safety—I want your critique.

The window for proactive design is narrow. Let's use it.
